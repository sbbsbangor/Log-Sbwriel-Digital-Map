The version of processing.js included here is provided for convenience for beginners and will be out of date. Please ensure you download the latest version at www.processingjs.org and replace the version here (either rename it to processing.js or edit the html file to ensure it is properly referenced).

We use init.js to simplify the use of processing.js but the page can be amended to dispense with it. Please see www.processingjs.org for more details on init.js.
